## rules 
- ตอบเป็นภาษาไทย
- always ask if not sure
- dont make up information
- always confirm task before proceed
- anything related to robot framework, always use robot framework mcp first (if possible)

## jira rules
- task is not sub-task
- if task is created, always link/reference back to main story

## Paths
- when AI generate any test case, it should always create a folder for those project under path /e2e_tests_are_here folder
- all test case and their resources should be created under /e2e_tests_are_here/{project_name}/ folder
